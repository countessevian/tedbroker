# Chat Support Agent Names Implementation

## Overview
Users now see a random human name from a pool of 5 support agent names when chatting with support. Each user's conversation is assigned one name that persists throughout their conversation, regardless of which admin actually responds.

## Implementation Details

### Support Agent Name Pool
The following 5 names are randomly assigned to conversations:
- Sarah Mitchell
- James Thompson
- Emily Rodriguez
- Michael Chen
- Jessica Williams

### How It Works

1. **New Conversations**: When a user starts a new chat conversation, a random agent name is selected from the pool and stored in the `assigned_agent_name` field of the conversation document.

2. **Admin Replies**: When any admin sends a reply, the system uses the conversation's `assigned_agent_name` instead of the admin's actual name.

3. **Consistency**: The same agent name is shown to the user for all messages in that conversation, creating a consistent experience.

### Modified Files

#### `/app/routes/chat.py`
- Added `SUPPORT_AGENT_NAMES` constant with the 5 agent names
- Modified conversation creation to assign a random agent name
- Added `import random` for name selection

#### `/app/routes/admin.py` (Line 1974-1983)
- Modified admin reply endpoint to use `assigned_agent_name` from conversation
- Removed dependency on actual admin's full name
- Falls back to "Support Team" if no assigned name exists

### Database Schema
New field added to `chat_conversations` collection:
```python
{
    "assigned_agent_name": str,  # One of the 5 support agent names
    # ... other fields
}
```

### Migration
Existing conversations have been updated with the migration script (`migrate_chat_conversations.py`):
- 2 existing conversations were updated
- Each was assigned a random agent name from the pool

### User Experience
- Users see a consistent, human name throughout their conversation
- The name appears in the chat widget next to admin messages
- Different users will see different agent names
- Same user keeps the same agent name for their conversation

### Admin Experience
- Admins see the actual conversation details in their dashboard
- Any admin can respond to any conversation
- The user always sees the same assigned agent name, regardless of which admin responds
- This provides privacy for admin identities while maintaining personalization for users
