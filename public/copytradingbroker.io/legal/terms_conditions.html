                The content provided on this platform is intended solely for informational and educational purposes and does not constitute financial, investment, or trading advice. Copy trading involves the automatic replication of another trader's positions and does not guarantee profits or protection from losses. Past performance of any trader or trading strategy does not guarantee future results. By using this platform, you acknowledge that all trading decisions are made at your own risk. You are solely responsible for evaluating the merits and risks associated with using copy trading services. We strongly recommend conducting your own research and seeking advice from a qualified financial advisor before engaging in any trading activities.

				<br><br>

				Trading in financial instruments—including but not limited to forex, CFDs, stocks, and cryptocurrencies—carries a high level of risk and may not be suitable for all investors. Leverage can amplify gains, but it can also increase potential losses. You should never invest more than you can afford to lose.

				<br><br>

				The platform, its operators, affiliates, or associated third parties are not liable for any losses incurred, whether directly or indirectly, as a result of reliance on information available through this service or the actions of any copied traders. Always ensure you fully understand the risks and features of the financial instruments you intend to trade, and make use of risk management tools where possible.
