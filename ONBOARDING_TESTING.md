## üîç Verification

### Check Data in Database
You can verify the data is stored correctly by checking MongoDB:

```bash
# Connect to MongoDB
mongosh "mongodb+srv://brockbailey706_db_user:VAjJy8CSr9N9wYBi@cluster0.mzeaxhl.mongodb.net/tedbroker"

# Query user's onboarding data
db.users.findOne({email: "your-email@example.com"}, {onboarding: 1, full_name: 1, gender: 1, country: 1})
```

Expected structure:
```json
{
  "full_name": "John Doe",
  "gender": "Male",
  "country": "United States",
  "onboarding": {
    "first_name": "John",
    "last_name": "Doe",
    "gender": "Male",
    "personal_info_completed": true,
    "street": "123 Main St",
    "city": "New York",
    "state": "NY",
    "zip_code": "10001",
    "country": "United States",
    "address_completed": true,
    "document_number": "AB123456",
    "document_photo": "/uploads/kyc/USER_ID_TIMESTAMP.jpg",
    "kyc_completed": true,
    "kyc_status": "pending_review",
    "kyc_submitted_at": ISODate("2025-10-27T09:10:00.000Z"),
    "completed_at": ISODate("2025-10-27T09:10:00.000Z")
  }
}
```

### Check Uploaded Files

```
